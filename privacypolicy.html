                <p>To Our Individual Clients:</p>

                <p>
                    Your privacy is important to us, and maintaining your trust and confidence is one of our highest priorities.

                </p><p>
                    A recent law change requires us to disclose our Privacy Policy to you &ndash; which we are more than happy to do.
                </p><p>
                    We hope that by taking a few minutes to read it, you will have a better understanding of what we do with the information you provide us and how we keep it private and secure.
                </p>

                <p>A. Types of Information We Collect</p>

                <p> We collect certain personal information about you &ndash; but only when that information is provided by you or is obtained by us with your authorization.    We use that information to contact you regarding future projects you may wish to discuss with us.</p>

                    In conjunction with a prospective purchase, sale, or merger of all or part of our practice, provided that we take appropriate precautions (for example, through a written confidentiality agreement) so the prospective purchaser or merger partner does not disclose information obtained in the course of the review.
